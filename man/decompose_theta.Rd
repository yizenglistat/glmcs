\title{Decompose Row Sums of a Theta Matrix into Single-Effect Components}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{A numeric matrix of shape \code{p × L}.}

\item{L}{Integer. Number of columns in the output matrix.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of shape \code{p × L}, where each row sum matches
the corresponding row sum of \code{theta}, and each row has only one nonzero entry.
}
\description{
Given a \eqn{p \times L} matrix \code{theta}, this function redistributes
the row sums into a new matrix of the same shape where each row's total
effect is placed into a single column (using round-robin assignment).

This operation is useful for decomposing a combined effect vector into
sparse single-effect columns (e.g., in spike-and-slab regression or
additive effect models).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
theta <- matrix(rnorm(12), nrow = 6, ncol = 2)
theta_new <- decompose_theta(theta, L = 2)
all.equal(rowSums(theta), rowSums(theta_new))  # Should be TRUE
}

}
