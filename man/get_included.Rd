\title{Determine Significant Components in a LASER Model}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{List containing LASER model fit objects, including:
- theta: coefficient matrix
- intercept: model intercept
- dispersion: dispersion parameter
- final_loglike: log-likelihood of the full model}

\item{X}{NumericMatrix (n × p) predictor matrix.}

\item{y}{Response variable: vector for GLM, matrix (time, status) for Cox.}

\item{family}{List (for GLM) or string "cox".}

\item{alpha}{Numeric scalar. Significance level for the tests. Default is 0.05.}
}
\value{
LogicalVector indicating which latent dimensions are significant.
}
\description{
Tests which latent components in a LASER model are statistically significant
using likelihood ratio tests.
}
\details{
For each latent dimension ℓ, the function performs a likelihood ratio test by:
\enumerate{
\item Setting the coefficients for dimension ℓ to zero (null model)
\item Computing the log-likelihood of this restricted model
\item Comparing with the full model's log-likelihood using a chi-squared test
\item Determining significance based on the provided alpha level
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assuming 'laser_fit' is a fitted LASER model with 3 latent dimensions
X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 10), 100, 10)
y <- rnorm(100)
significant_dims <- get_included(laser_fit, X, y, "gaussian", alpha = 0.01)
}
