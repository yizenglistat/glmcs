\title{Combine p-values using Fisher's Method}
\usage{
combine_fisher(pvals)
}
\arguments{
\item{pvals}{A numeric vector of p-values (typically for the same predictor across models or effects).}
}
\value{
A scalar: the Fisher-combined p-value.
}
\description{
Aggregates a vector of p-values using Fisher's method, which tests the union null
hypothesis that all component tests are null. This method is powerful when multiple
weak signals are present across independent or weakly correlated tests.
}
\details{
The test statistic is \eqn{T = -2 \sum \log(p_i)}, which follows a
chi-squared distribution with \eqn{2k} degrees of freedom under the null,
where \eqn{k} is the number of p-values.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
p <- c(0.01, 0.2, 0.04)
combine_fisher(p)
}
