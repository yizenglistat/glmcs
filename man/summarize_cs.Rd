\title{Summarize Multi‐Set Confidence Regions Across Simulations}
\usage{
summarize_cs(cs_list, true_active, decimal = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{cs_list}{List of length \code{n_sims}. Each element is either:
\itemize{
\item an R list (e.g. \code{list(cs1=..., cs2=..., …)}) of integer vectors,
\item \code{NULL} or an empty list, meaning no confidence sets returned.
}
Each inner integer vector holds the indices in a single confidence set.}

\item{true_active}{Integer vector of the true active variable indices.}

\item{decimal}{Nonnegative integer.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with columns:
\describe{
\item{set}{Character: each unique simulation pattern rendered as
comma‐separated set literals, e.g.\  "\{1,4\}, \{2,3\}".  An empty
pattern is shown as "\{\}".}
\item{count}{Integer: number of simulations that produced exactly that
pattern of sets.}
\item{percent}{Numeric: \code{count} divided by \code{n_sims}.}
\item{cover}{Logical: \code{TRUE} if the union of all sets in the pattern
contains \emph{every} element of \code{true_active}.}
}
Rows are sorted in descending order of \code{count}.
}
\description{
Given a list of simulation results where each run may return multiple
confidence sets (e.g. \code{cs1}, \code{cs2}, …), this function enumerates
the distinct patterns of sets, counts how often each occurs, computes the
fraction of simulations, and tests whether the \strong{union} of all sets in
a pattern covers the true active variables.  Within each pattern, the
individual sets are ordered first by their size (smallest first), then
lexicographically by their indices.
