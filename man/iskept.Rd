\title{Select Columns with Significant Concentration or Non-Uniformity}
\usage{
iskept(pval, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{pval}{A numeric matrix of p-values (dimension: \code{p Ã— L}), where each column corresponds to a single effect.}

\item{alpha}{Significance threshold for p-value aggregation (default = 0.05).}
}
\value{
A logical vector of length \code{L} indicating selected columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{TRUE} if a column is retained (i.e., passes threshold or selected as fallback)
\item \code{FALSE} otherwise
}
Column names are preserved if available. At least one column will always be selected.
}
\description{
This function identifies columns in a probability matrix that are either:
(1) statistically significant using a column-wise p-value aggregation method (e.g., Simes),
or (2) deviate most from uniformity if none are significant.
}
\details{
Columns are assessed using a p-value combination method (e.g., \code{combine_simes}).
If no column has an aggregated p-value below \code{alpha}, the fallback is to select
the column that is most non-uniform (farthest from the uniform distribution).
}
\note{
Assumes each column in \code{pval} contains valid p-values.
Uses \code{combine_simes()} to aggregate p-values per column.
