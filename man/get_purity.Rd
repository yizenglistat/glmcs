\title{Calculate Purity Statistics for LASER Model Variables}
\arguments{
\item{pos}{IntegerVector containing indices of selected variables (1-based indexing).}

\item{X}{Matrix. Original predictor matrix (n x p).
If provided, correlations are calculated from this matrix.
Not required if R is provided.}

\item{R}{Matrix. Pre-calculated correlation matrix (p x p).
Not required if X is provided.}

\item{squared}{Logical. If TRUE, squared correlation values are used. Default is FALSE.}

\item{n_purity}{Integer. Maximum number of observations to use when calculating
correlations from X. Default is 100.}
}
\value{
NumericVector with three elements:
\itemize{
\item Minimum absolute correlation among selected variables
\item Mean absolute correlation among selected variables
\item Median absolute correlation among selected variables
}
If only one variable is selected, returns (1.0, 1.0, 1.0).
}
\description{
Computes purity statistics (minimum, mean, and median of absolute correlation values)
for a set of selected variables. Purity measures help assess variable independence
within selected groups.
}
\details{
Purity is calculated based on the absolute correlation values between pairs of
selected variables. The function can either use a provided correlation matrix or
compute correlations from the raw data matrix. For large datasets, a random subset
of observations can be used to calculate correlations more efficiently.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# With raw data matrix
X <- matrix(rnorm(1000 * 20), 1000, 20)
selected_vars <- c(1, 5, 10, 15)
get_purity(selected_vars, X = X)

# With correlation matrix
Xcorr <- cor(X)
get_purity(selected_vars, R = Xcorr, squared = TRUE)
}
